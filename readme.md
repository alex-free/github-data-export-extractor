Github Data Export Extractor
============================

By Alex Free

Github Data Export Extractor makes the `.tar.gz` file generated by the Github [data export feature](https://github.blog/2018-12-19-download-your-data/) more useful for archival purposes. It extracts from the `.tar.gz` file all repositories and released files for your repositories, and then puts them in a easy to use backup directory. This is much nicer to have then what [Github](https://github.com) provides with their [data export feature](https://github.blog/2018-12-19-download-your-data/) alone. See the [usage](#usage) section for more info.

Usage

### The Problem (Background Info On Why I Made This)

[Github](https://github.com) provides a [data export feature](https://github.blog/2018-12-19-download-your-data/) that allows you to "download all your GitHub data". This gives you a `.tar.gz` file that you can download from GitHub. I don't like the way GitHub provides this data export though as it is terrible for backing up because:

*   It does not contain git repos, instead it contains `.pack` files of the repos.
*   Every file released for your git repos is in a different directory which only contain the single Github released file.
*   Besides my repositories and releases for each repository, I don't want any other files in a backup. The GitHub data export contains a bunch of `.json` files and other things I don't really need in my case.

### The Solution

I wrote Github Data Export Extractor. It extracts the Github data export `.tar.gz` file and generates a new backup directory that contains 2 sub directories:

*   `repositories` - contains all of your repos.
*   `releases` - contains all of your released files for your repos.

### How To Use It

[Download](#downloads) and extract the latest Github Data Export Extractor release. Inside is `gdee`, which is a bash script that takes only two arguments:

*   The first argument is the `.tar.gz` file you download through the Github Data Export on Github.
*   The second argument is the name of the backup directory you want to create from the `tar.gz` file.

Sample:

`./gdee 9d9617f2-11b5-11ec-35c8-2dfe00aa20a5.tar.gz alex-free-2-21-2022`

This extracts all repos and released files from the Github data export `.tar.gz` file and puts it in a new directory named "alex-free-2-21-2022".
